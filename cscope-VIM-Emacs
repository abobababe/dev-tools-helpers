1st. find src/xc32/xc32-gcc -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' -o -name '*.def' > cscope.files
2nd. call cscope and use cscope.files as the input.
     cscope -b -q cscope.files
     Congrats! we can now use cscope to quickly traverse our code.

3nd. pass the same list of files to ctags-universal
     ctags-universal -e -L cscope.files   (mind you the -e flag is for emacs mode)
     Now, we can traverse our code easily AND jump to definitions, uses, and related files with use via tags
